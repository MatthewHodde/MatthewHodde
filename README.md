# Purpose of this Namespace/Profile

This profile exists exclusively for collaboration with other projects that are unable or unwilling to use other means of sharing work.

My personal projects are hosted elsewhere and any repos found under my namespace should be considered mirrors (likely of forks with github dependent upstream workflows).

([See Software Freedom Conservancy's *Give Up  GitHub* site for details](https://GiveUpGitHub.org).)

# Rejection of Copilot
Any use of code I have authored by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done without my permission. I do not consent to GitHub's use of any of my code in Copilot (or any other similar product).

My rejection of Copilot and lack of consent is independent of the terms of any licence associated with my work or with projects I contribute to. 

Just because your can (legally or otherwise) scrape my code does not mean you should.

# Give up github!

Join us; you can [give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) too!
